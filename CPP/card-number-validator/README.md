<h1 align="center">card-number-validator ðŸ’³</h1>

> A simple C++ cli program that validates your credit card and returns basic information, based only on its number

![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-%2300599C.svg?style=flat&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)

## Installation

Simply clone the repository compile the file and run the program:

```
cd card-number-validator
g++ -o card cpp.cpp
./card
```

> **Note**: This project is far from perfect, analysing CC numbers offers tons of information about the credit card itself, but these specifications are simply too many to include in such a simple program
