<h1 align="center">Fibonacci </h1>

> Two implementations of the fibonacci algorithm. This program takes the length of the desired fibonacci sequence and returns it. It is accurate up until 1000 fibonacci numbers (a number with 209 digits)

![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-%2300599C.svg?style=flat&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)

## Features

- Using the boost library to make use of 1024bit unsigned integers, it can calculate with accuracy up to the 1000th fibonacci number (a number with just 209 digits)
- The fib_better.cpp file is simpler but showcases the recursive algorithm

## Installation

Simply clone the repository and compile the files.

```
cd fibonacci/cpp
g++ -o fib cpp.cpp
./fib
```
